This is a UIButton that displays a number on it, allows the user to press and hold and increase or decrease the value displayed. Currently, it only displays integers.

The scaling value is the number that determines how far the user has to drag their finger to get the value displayed to change. 

To remove a minimum value, set it to nil.
